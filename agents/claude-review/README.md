# claude-review

> Claude Code sub-agent that reviews a GitHub PR and posts a structured Markdown comment.

`claude-review` fetches a PR diff via the GitHub API, analyzes it for risks and improvements, and outputs a structured Markdown review. Use it from the CLI, as a Claude Code sub-agent, or in a GitHub Action.

Bounty submission for [issue #4](https://github.com/claude-builders-bounty/claude-builders-bounty/issues/4).

## Quick start

```bash
# CLI (matches acceptance criteria)
chmod +x claude-review
claude-review --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Post review as a PR comment
claude-review --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --post

# Direct Python invocation
python agents/claude-review/claude_review.py --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Save output to a file
claude-review --pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 -o review.md
```

Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or pass `--token`) with `repo` scope for private repos or `public_repo` for public repositories.

## Claude Code sub-agent

Copy the agent definition into your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp agents/claude-review/.claude/agents/claude-review.md .claude/agents/
```

Then invoke it in Claude Code:

```
Use the claude-review agent to review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

The sub-agent runs the CLI and returns structured Markdown. See [`.claude/agents/claude-review.md`](.claude/agents/claude-review.md) for the full agent prompt.

## Output format

Every review includes:

- **Summary of Changes** — 2–3 sentences plus file breakdown
- **Identified Risks** — checklist of potential issues
- **Improvement Suggestions** — actionable recommendations
- **Confidence Score** — `Low`, `Medium`, or `High`

## GitHub Action

Copy the workflow into your repository:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp agents/claude-review/.github/workflows/claude-review.yml .github/workflows/claude-review.yml
```

The included workflow uses `pull_request` (not `pull_request_target`) and checks out the trusted base branch. It posts the review as a PR comment automatically.

## How reviews work

1. Fetch PR metadata via GitHub REST API (title, description, files, commits)
2. Fetch the full PR diff
3. Flag risks: large diffs, TODO/FIXME markers, debug statements, commented-out code, hardcoded secrets, large single-file additions
4. Generate suggestions for commit granularity, cross-language changes, and PR descriptions
5. Compute a confidence score from PR size and file count
